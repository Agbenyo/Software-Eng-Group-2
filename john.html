	<h2>Black Star Square</h2>
	<div>
		<div class="tyu">
		<div style="line-height: 1.5em;">
			This piece was also commissioned by Kwame Nkrumah for the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Accra. The 'Black Star' represents freedom of all black people. It was inspired by Marcus Garvey's shipping company, Black Star Line in 1919.Black Star Square is located between 28th February Road and Accra's southern coastline. It's always open to the public unless there are ticketed events taking place. Be careful when taking photographs of the square and its monuments. Since 2011, the Independence Arch has been guarded by a handful of soldiers who prohibit people taking close-up photos of the Arch. It's best to always ask permission before taking any photos of monuments on the square, especially if they're being guarded by soldiers.In terms of overall size, there is an oft-repeated claim that Black Star Square is the second largest city square in the world after Tiananmen Square in Beijing. That, however, is wrong on a few counts. Firstly, Tiananmen Square is not the largest square in the world, but does sit comfortably in the top 10. Secondly, Black Star Square has an approximate area of 1,057,238 square feet (98,220 sq meters), and that’s a generous approximation. That could maybe squeeze the square into the world’s top 30 at best, perhaps rivaling Millennium Park in Chicago. And then, of course, there’s the whole definition of city parks, parade grounds etc. Still, it’s fair to say that Black Star Square could well be the largest square of its type in Africa, and that’s no mean achievement

    <h2>Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum and Memorial Park</h2>
	<div>
		<div class="tyu">
		<div style="line-height: 1.5em;">
			Kwame Nkrumah, the memorial park was built on a former British Polo field where Ghana's independence was declared in 1957. The Mausoleum is a magnificent Marble Monument and the last resting place of the first President of Ghana and his wife, Fathia Nkrumah.The Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum and National Park was built on the old Polo Ground and dedicated to the first president of Ghana, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah in 1992 under the presidency of Jerry John Rawlings. The aim of the mausoleum is to preserve the legacy and historical artifacts of the man who won independence for Ghana and regarded by many as the founder of the nation.

The Mausoleum is located directly opposite the old Parliament House of Ghana, which now serves as the office of the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ). With a total land surface of 5.3 acres, the Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum is the largest Historical Museum in Ghana. Just in front of the Mausoleum is the Huge statue of Kwame Nkrumah, which can be seen from afar.

While only the statue of Kwame Nkrumah can be seen from afar, the interior of the mausoleum has several sections including the graveside and tomb of the late president as well as museum that contains all his memoirs, from signed documents to photographs he took with some of the world’s most powerful and celebrated men of the 20th Century.

    <h2>Christiansborg Castle (Osu Castle)</h2>
	<div>
		<div class="tyu">
		<div style="line-height: 1.5em;">
			The castle's origins can be traced to a lodge built by Swedes in 1652. Nine years later, the Danish built a fort on the site and called it Fort Christiansborg (“Christian's Fortress”), named after the King of Denmark, Christian IV. Over time, the fort was enlarged and converted into a castle.In 1661, Jost Cramer, the Danish governor of the Cape Coast fort, Fort Fredericksborg, obtained the site for 3,200 gold florins, from Paramount Chief Okaikoi of the Ga ethnic group.

At this site, the Danes built a stone fort in 1659, to replace the earthen lodge that had been erected by the Swedish African Company in the 17th century. They named it Christiansborg, meaning ‘Christian’s Fortress’, after the King of Denmark, Christian IV, who passed away in 1648.
After 1876, British colonial governors ruled from the castle. They abandoned it from 1890 to 1901, when it was used as a constabulary mess, and later as a psychiatric asylum. In 1902, Christiansburg Castle once again became the seat of government, and today, the elegant edifice houses the offices of the President of Ghana.

Its location by the Atlantic Ocean was advantageous for trading purposes. It made it easy for the James Lighthouse to identify ships that were arriving at the coast in order to regulate them. Goods were kept and transported into the arriving ships likewise slaves. These slaves were kept in dungeons at the ends of the castle, transporting them through the DOOR OF NO RETURN to the arriving ships.
There have been many historic visits at the castle by international dignitaries including Queen Elizabeth II and U.S Presidents namely Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.    Visitors may take great interest in memorable sights such as the credential rooms used by the former British officials and former Ghanaian presidents, slave dungeons, walkway to the Door of No Return, a water reserve and a chapel sometimes used by the Anglican Church.
 Visitors would be given the opportunity to take photographs of the captivating sea shore, fishing boats, extensive gardens with a wide varieties of plants and the township by the castle.
The castle allows visitors access to a car park and walkway around the gardens.

    <h2>Labadi Beach</h2>
	<div>
		<div class="tyu">
		<div style="line-height: 1.5em;">
			The Accra coastline is dotted with many public beaches, castles and forts. All these beautiful public spaces offer access to the beautiful view of the Atlantic Ocean crashing against the shore. Labadi Beach, however, is unique among these for its range of dynamic beachside activities. It offers a great urban beach experience, with a clean beachfront, good food and music and new friends just around the corne.Labadi Beach, officially known as the La Pleasure Beach, is a scenic stretch of sand situated in Labadi, a suburb of Accra. It is not to be confused with the La Palm Royal Beach Hotel or the Labadi Beach Hotel, both of which are upscale hotel beaches in the same vicinity. It is the most popular beach in Ghana, with a spacious shoreline lined with sparse coconut trees and plenty of activities on offer.There are dozens of bars littered across the place, where you can enjoy cool beers or try out locally-brewed gin and spirits like Akpeteshi or Shocker. These very potent drinks, consumed in moderation, are the drink of choice for many local beach goers. There are also hookah bars in smoking areas, for those who enjoy tobacco.

The food is also a treat although it is mainly street food. Local favourites like charcoal-grilled tilapia, spicy kebabs and jollof rice are sold for very cheap. There are also stalls where you can buy continental dishes like french fries, burgers and salads.</div><br><br>
