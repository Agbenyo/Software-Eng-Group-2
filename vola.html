         	   <h2>Mount Afadja</h2>
<div style="line-height: 1.5em;">
	Mount Afadja is one of the highest mountains in Ghana standing at an elevation of 885 metres (2,904 ft). The mountain is located in the Agumatsa Range near the villages of Gbledi and Liati Wote, in the Volta Region of Ghana at the border with Togo. ‘Afadja’ is the name of the mountain whereas ‘to’ in the Ewe dialect means mountain therefore, it is called ‘Afadjato’ by the indigenes. The correct name would be ‘Mount Afadja’ as ‘Mount Afadjato’ will be a repetition of the ‘Mountain.’ Mount Afadja is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the Volta Region of Ghana welcoming thousands of visitors from around the globe annually.
About a kilometer (less than a mile) to the east, is the nearby peak of Aduadu, which is higher than Afadjato, also standing at over 900 metres.
When the indigenes migrated to the area and saw the mountain it looked like the mound in which water yam is planted, water yam being called “Avadze” in Ewe. Moreover there were some creeping plants on the mountain that resembled the water yam plant; they therefore called it “Avadze-to”. Today the word has been palatalized into “Afadjato”.
The nearby Tagbo Falls and Wli Falls (the highest in West Africa) are also considered tourist attractions. There are several hidden attractions of caves, streams and other waterfalls in the area.Stop by the pleasant visitors centre on left at the signpost as you enter the village. Sit on the shaded porch as you meet your guide and plan your tour.Take the steep climb up Mt. Afajato with a guide and be rewarded with stunning views in clear weather (note views are generally poor during the Harmattan season (November- March). Time: 2.5 hours. Difficulty: 3 (Note: you can also arrange an overnight hike to continue form the top of Mt. Afadjato to camp atop neighbouring Mt. Aduadu and return the next day).Hike to the impressive Tagbo Falls as your guide points out interesting features of the coffee and cocoa farms end route, as well as the beautiful semi-deciduous forest. When you reach the falls, take a refreshing plunge in the chilly waters of the pool at its base. Time: 2 hours. Difficulty: 2
Tour the village and a mushroom farm with a guide. See palm tapping to make palm wine and have a taste if you wish. See residents at work and preparing food. Time: variable.
