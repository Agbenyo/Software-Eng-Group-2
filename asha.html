	<h2>Manhyia Palace Museum</h2>
<div style="line-height: 1.5em;">
	The Museum is a unique creation in West Africa by the Asante Kingdom, to commemorate their leaders, and to communicate the riches of their history and culture to the world. It is a relatively small Museum but stuffed with history larger and older than its size making a visit to the place a worthy one.
The Museum building is of great historical interest and importance as it also houses the Museum’s exhibits such as royal regalia, photographs, medals, furniture, drums and palanquins which are over two hundred years, a battle dress which dates back to 1900 and many objects of historical significance as well as effigies of all past kings and the current occupant of the Golden Stool.
Visitors to the Museum will be able to view video-presentations explaining Asante history and the richness of its culture, as well as splendid examples of the gold-work for which the Asante are world-famous. These include gold weights, bracelets and pots for gold dust which were removed from the Palace by Lord Baden Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts Movement and a member of the British expeditionary force in Kumasi in 1896. Here too are the life-sized effigies of the Nana Prempeh I, Nana Yaa Akyaa and the legendary Nana Yaa Asantewaa, Queen of Ejisu, who in 1900 led the uprising and last of the seven Asante wars with the British, when the British Governor demanded the surrender to him of Asikadwa (Gold Stool).The Manhyia Palace Museum was created within the old residence of Otumfuo Agyeman Prempeh I and Otumfuo Sir Osei Agyeman Prempeh II, the thirteenth and fourteenth Kings of Asante respectively. This historic building was rehabilitated in 1995 at the cost of approximately twelve thousand Ghana cedis (GHc12,000) to serve as a Museum. The cost of rehabilitation was met by generous contributions in cash and in-kind by friends and well-wishers of Asanteman and the King.The Museum is unique in West Africa for it has been created by a single people, the Asante Nation, to commemorate their own leaders, and to communicate the riches of their history and culture to future generations and to the ever-increasing numbers of visitors who come to Ghana every year from all over the world.
The Museum building is of great historical interest and importance. It not only houses the Museum’s exhibits; it is itself an exhibit of the Museum. It was built in 1925 for Asantehene Agyeman Prempeh I, by the British Colonial Government, as his private residence when he returned from Seychelles after twenty-eight years in exile.
It was from this Palace that he ruled, for his people kept his Stool – the Asikadwa (the Gold Stool) – vacant during the twenty-eight years he was away in exile and welcomed him back as Asantehene. To the Asante, therefore, the period that he was away in exile (1896 to 1924) was not an interregnum and to remove any doubt as to his status or their relationship to him, they steadfastly refused to allow their King to accept the building as a gift from the British Colonial Government, or to occupy it until they had paid for it. The building, therefore, became, from the moment it was occupied by Asantehene Prempeh I, the AHENFIE -the Palace. It was the Palace of Nana Prempeh I, and his successor, Otumfuo Sir Osei Agyeman Prempeh II, who reigned from 1931 to 1970

	   <h2>Lake Bosomtwe</h2>
<div style="line-height: 1.5em;">
	Lake Bosomtwe is the only true inland lake in the country located in the Ashanti region. It is an awesome place to relax and enjoy nature. The lake has no surface outlet and was formed in a meteorite impact crater with an area of 19 square miles (49 square km) and a depth of 230–240 feet (70–73 metres), The lake is surrounded by lush mountains and fed by small streams that tumble down the crater’s steep sides (500–1,400 feet [150–425 metres] above water level).

Situated in the Ashanti region of Ghana, Lake Bosomtwe is one of six UNESCO designated biosphere reserve sites. It is one of three of such internationally recognized sites in the country – Bia in the Western, and Songhor in Greater Accra Region.

  

The southernmost section of the site overlaps the northern section of the Bosomtwe Range Forest Reserve creating a combination of forest, wetland and mountain ecosystems. The biosphere reserve sustains 35 tree species, including some used for timber. The site is also home to a great diversity of wildlife and a human population of over 50,000 inhabitants whose main economic activities are farming, fishing and tourism, as the lake is a major national tourist destination. The area is widely used for research, especially on climate change, as well as environmental education for schools and universities.Before the asteroid impact, the area was a lush rainforest filled with animals. Following the impact, the resulting crater filled with water forming Lake Bosumtwi.[13]

Periods of heavy rainfall filled the crater with water, causing the lake level to rise above the lowest points of the rim. Such periods are evidenced from fossils of fish found on hilltops. Water even flowed from the basin through an overflow channel. However, there were also times when the water level was so low that the rainforest entered the basin rendering the lake only a small pond. Such a period, according to legend and now proved by paleoclimate records, lasted until about 300 years ago

	<h2>Okomfo Anokye Sword Site</h2>
<div style="line-height: 1.5em;">
	
	Situated on the grounds of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, is the Komfo Anokye Sword Site which is seminal in Asante history. An over 300 year old sword wedged in the rockface is one of the centre artefacts and legends of the rich history of the Asante nation. The history of the Asante people is eloquently told by the young curator. On a good day you may run into the Asante king who regularly comes to pay his respects at this important and sacred site.
A tour of the site offers one great insight about the beginning of the Ashanti Kingdom. The landmark has been protected for future generations. This site is a historical landmark where the Legendary Okomfo Anokye Sword is cited.
The Sword site is the exact place where the Golden Stool of Asanteman descended unto the laps of King Osei Tutu I, “Opemsuo” the founder of Asante Nation. The site was predicted by Okomfo Anokye to be a healing place for millions of people.
Lo and behold, the site happens to be the exact place where the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital is situated.
One fascinating story about the Sword is that, since it was planted in 1695, countless number of attempts had been made to remove it from the ground but to no avail.
The ‘immovable’ Sword driven into the ground by Okomfo Anokye remains and is the venue of the Okomfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. History has it that the sword was pushed into the ground, almost 300 years ago. It is believed the Okomfo pronounced that no one would be able to remove the sword, and so it has remained in spite of attempts. The Ashanti state, it is believed, would collapse should the sword ever be pulled out of the ground.Okomfo Anokye (also known as Kwame Agyei, Kotowbere, or Tsala) was a traditional priest in the Asante Empire. He is known for his participation in the expansion of the Ashanti Empire.
There are multiple accounts regarding Okomfo Anokye’s origins.
According to Akuapem tradition, he was son of Ano and Manubea, both from Awukugua in the Nifa Division of the Okere state. His name would originate from an incident :
This claim was apparently latter confirmed by Otumfuo Nana Osei Tutu II during his visit at Awukugua in 2014.
According to Asante traditions, he was the grandson of a man called Amoa Gyata from Bona-Bom, Adanse. There are also claims that he was the son of Kyei Birie and Dwirawira Kwa, who was an Asenie woman from Adanse-Akrokyere.
According to Anlo-Ewe traditions, Okomfo Anokye was from Notsie. His original name was Tsala, and he was the twin brother of Tsali. His name would thus originate from an Asante corruption of “Notsie” i.e “Okomfo of Notsie”.The Ewe mythology that Okomfo Anokye was from Notsie and Asantes called him Okomfo Anokye signifying “Okomfo a ofiri Notsie” (i.e.: Okomfo who comes from Notsie) cannot be reconciled with Asante or indeed Akan naming conventions.Asante/Akan naming conventions that signify a person’s origins do not affix an “A” to the beginning of the origin. Rather, Asante/Akan convention from time immemorial appends “ni”, “ba”, “ni ba” or “dehyee” to the end of the origin. Thus among Akans, a person from Notsie will be called “Notsie-ni “ (from Notsie), “Notsie-ba” (Offspring of Notsie), “Notsie-ni ba” (offspring of a child of Notsie), or “Notsie dehyee” (a royal of Notsie) but never “A Notsie”.Nobody from Nsuta, say, will be called “A-Nsuta” among Akans. Rather, a person from Nsuta may be called Nsuta-ni, Nsuta-ba, Nsuta-ni ba, or Nsuta-dehyee to signify the person’s Nsuta origins.
The alternative naming convention among Akans is to mention the ethnic origins of a person. Thus, if Okomfo Anokye was from Notsie, the Asantes/Akans could call him Okomfo Anwona or Okomfo Ayigbe but never Okomfo Anokye since the Akans call Ewes Anwona or Ayigbe but never Anokye.
According to Nzema traditions, he was from Benyin
